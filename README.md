# Pololu DC motor position PID control using Arduino
This project implements closed-loop position control of a Pololu 70:1 metal gearmotor (4754) using an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi and a Pololu Dual G2 High-Power Motor Shield 24v14 (M1). A panel rotary encoder serves as the UI: turning the knob adjusts a “dialed” target, and pressing the knob latches that value as the setpoint. The motor’s built-in quadrature encoder provides feedback.
The controller is a position-based PID written in Arduino C++. Timing uses micros() for Δt. Encoder decoding is 1× on the motor’s A channel rising edge with direction from B; resolution is 16 counts/rev at the motor shaft and, with the 70:1 gearbox, 1120 counts/rev at the output. A project constant ROT_STEP = 1120 maps one knob “step” to one output-shaft revolution. The PID output is mapped to the shield’s setM1Speed(−400…+400) command with a configurable PWM_MAX (e.g., 300) and a small deadband (e.g., 19) to skip the no-motion region. An anti-windup scheme prevents the integral term from growing when the output is saturated in the same direction as the error. Driver faults are monitored and halt the sketch if triggered.

Telemetry (setpoint and position, normalized to revolutions) is streamed over serial and plotted in MATLAB for fixed 0-based time axes and multi-series visualization during tuning. The result is a responsive, stable position loop with clean latching of knob targets and smooth convergence at the output shaft
